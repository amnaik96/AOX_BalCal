function [customMatrix_rec, FLAGS]= modelOpt_suggestedNew(VIFthresh, customMatrix, customMatrix_req, loaddimFlag, nterms, comIN0, anova_pct, targetMatrix0, high, FLAGS)
% Searches for the 'suggested math model'.  This is an improved version of
% the approach described in Balfit Reference B29.  The "suggested" math
% model search is a faster search process than searching for the
% "recommended" math model. It does not optimize as search metric, but instead just searches for an
% equation where there are no near-linear dependencies between math terms,
% the hierarchy rule is satisfied (optional), and all terms are
% statistically significant.  It searches between the upper and lower
% bounds for terms in the model:
% Upper Bounds: provided current customMatrix
% Lower Bounds: Linear voltage from channel and tares

% Hierarchy can be enforced in 2 ways:
% high_con==1: Enforced following search: Terms are removed to meet VIF and
%       term significance constraints, then terms required to support remaining
%       terms are added back in.  This may result in a final math model where all
%       terms do not satisfy the VIF and/or significance constraints
% high_con==2: Enforced during search: Terms are removed to meet VIF and
%       term significance constraints. As terms are removed, all terms
%       requiring term for support are also removed. Results in final math
%       model where all terms satisfy VIF and significance constraints,
%       although generally fewer terms will be included and may result in
%       higher residuals 

%The following process is used in this function:
% 1) Start with the provided 'permitted math model', obtained by applying
%       SVD. This model is fed into the current function
% 2) PHASE 1: Apply VIF constraint with elevated threshold: Compute VIF for all terms, remove term with
%       highest VIF, recompute VIF, repeat until max VIF is below elevated
%       threshold (50)
% 3) (Optional): Add missing lower order terms (high_con==1)
% 4) PHASE 2: Remove statistically 'insignificant' math terms: Find P values of all
%       regression coefficients from terms from previous step.  Remove term with
%       highest P-value.  Recompute, repeat until all all terms are
%       significant based on a lowered percent confidence (75%)
% 5) (Optional): Add missing lower order terms (high_con==1)
% 6) PHASE 3: Apply VIF constraint with final threshold: Compute VIF for all terms, remove term with
%       highest VIF, recompute VIF, repeat until max VIF is below final threshold
% 7) (Optional): Add missing lower order terms (high_con==1)
% 8) PHASE 4: Remove statistically 'insignificant' math terms: Find P values of all
%       regression coefficients from terms from previous step.  Remove term with
%       highest P-value.  Recompute, repeat until all all terms are
%       significant based on a final percent confidence
% 9) (Optional): Add missing lower order terms (high_con==1)
