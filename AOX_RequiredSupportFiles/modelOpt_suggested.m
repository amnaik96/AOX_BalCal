function [customMatrix_rec, FLAGS]= modelOpt_suggested(VIFthresh, customMatrix, customMatrix_req, loaddimFlag, nterms, comIN0, anova_pct, targetMatrix0, high, FLAGS)
% Function searches for the 'suggested math model' using the approach
% described in Balfit Reference B29.  This approach is a simplified and
% faster search process than searching for the "recommended" math model.
% It does not optimize as search metric, but instead just searches for an
% equation where there are no near-linear dependencies between math terms,
% the hierarchy rule is satisfied (optional), and all terms are
% statistically significant.  It searches between the upper and lower
% bounds for terms in the model:
% Upper Bounds: provided current customMatrix
% Lower Bounds: Linear voltage from channel and tares

%The following process is used in this function:
% 1) Start with the provided 'permitted math model', obtained by applying
%       SVD
% 2) PHASE 1: Apply VIF constraint: Compute VIF for all terms, remove term with
%       highest VIF, recompute VIF, repeat until max VIF is below threshold
% 3) PHASE 2: Apply Hierarchy Rule (optional): Add missing lower order terms
% 4) PHASE 3: Remove statistically 'insignificant' math terms: Find P values of all
%       regression coefficients from terms from step 3.  Remove all insignificant
%       terms as long as math model remains "hierarchical" (remove high order to
%       low order)

%INPUTS:
%  VIFthresh = Threshold for max allowed VIF (Balfit Search constraint 2)
%  customMatrix = Current matrix of what terms should be included in Eqn Set.
%  customMatrix_req = custom matrix of minimum terms that must be included in model
%  loaddimFlag = Dimension of load data (# channels)
%  nterms = Number of predictor terms in regression model
%  comIN0 = Matrix of predictor variables
%  anova_pct = ANOVA percent confidence level for determining significance
%  targetMatrix0 = Matrix of target load values
%  high = Matrix of term hierarchy
%  FLAGS = Structure containing flags for user preferences

%OUTPUTS:
%  customMatrix_rec = Optimized recommended custom matrix
%  FLAGS = Structure containing flags for user preferences
